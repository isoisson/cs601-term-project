            <!-- Introduction paragraph for interests -->
            <p>Aside from my professional and academic life, I love to travel around the world to explore new cultures.
                Traveling is my ultimate passion and it shapes my perspective. Exploring new places, cultures, and
                cuisines is my favorite way to spend time outside of work. Whether it's wandering the charming streets
                of a European city, savoring exotic street food in Southeast Asia, or simply gazing at the stars in a
                remote desert, each journey leaves an indelible mark on my heart and memories that I carry with me.
                Travel is a never-ending lesson and a constant reminder of the immense beauty and diversity that this
                world has to offer.</p>

            <p>To simplify things, here is a list of my most recent trips and some of my favorite things to do while I
                was there. Please note that cities in <b>bold</b> denote my favorite places:</p>
