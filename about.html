            </header>
            <p>Hi there! My name is Irene and I am thrilled to share a bit about myself. I believe in the power of
                connecting through words and stories so I'd like to warmly welcome you to my personal website. With a
                background in Business Management, I've worked in a variety of industries. In my prior role, I was a
                Program Manager for complex software development programs where I developed a passion for Computers and
                problem solving which led me towards pursuing a Master of Science in Software Development (MSSD). I am
                on a journey to expand my technical skills and make a positive impact for women in the tech industry.

            <p>My undergraduate degree was in Business Management. After 10 years of working in the Aerospace and
                Defense industry, I graduated with my Master of Business Administration. Following that, I was a Program

                development. As a result, I have taken several graduate courses to deepen my technical expertise while
                pursuing my MSSD. I am a lifelong learner and am always eager to acquire new skills and tackle exciting
                challenges. In fact, I am already exploring degrees for my next academic pursuit!</p>
