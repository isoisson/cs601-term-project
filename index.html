                <h2>Fun fact: I love the beach</h2>
            </header>
            <p>I live on the West Coast and I absolutely love the beach. There's something special about the way the
                golden sands meet the ocean waves. The soothing sound of the ocean and the warmth of the sun make me
                feel at peace. Whether it's building sandcastles, taking long walks along the boardwalk, or simply lying
                on a beach towel with a good book, the beach is where I find solace and joy. To me, the beach is a place
                where worries melt away, and I'm fully immersed in the beauty and serenity of the coastal world. I
                wanted you to experience a piece of that by sharing this video with you. This video captures the beauty
                of the beach, sunset, and nature. I hope you enjoy!</p>
